To do list for game jam:
- Add more blocks (make an actual level that's fun to play with the simple logic)
- Add more features/powers - e.g., lives, monsters, fire, invisibility, missiles,speed boosts and other stuff that you pick up or have or lose or ...
- Add player art, animations, sound, all the other assets of a good game

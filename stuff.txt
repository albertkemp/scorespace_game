1. Make New Friends (firstly because I need more friends and secondly so that doesn't exist in my life)✅
2. don't be an idiot in science and religion and PE class (probably my 2 classes that are most chaotic because Science has the dumb seating plan, but hopefully it should be fixed later)✅
3. Join clubs✅
